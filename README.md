## [this](#learnjavascript).repo

JavaScript in the browser has evolved. Developers who want to take advantage of the latest features have the option of going framework-less with less hassle.

Functionally normally reserved to front-end frameworks, like a component-based approach, is now feasible in plain old JavaScript.

This repo contains code for such app whose goal is to help people learn javascript by providing rhem with a beginner friendly _Javascript Playground._ (and also help [maintainers](I m currentlty still alone but Im open for contributions) learn through the process.)

Learn Javascript "data structures and algorithms" then practice them in Interactive Web app projects.
