Javascript is _a [High-Level](), [Single-Threaded](), [Garbage-Collected]() [Interpreted]() or [JIT compiled](), [Prototype-Based](), [multi-Paradigm](), [dynamic](), Language with a [non-Blocking]() [Event concurency model]()_.

Ik; get a quick into on [how its made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSs_JYwnAdI) 😂

Kudos to [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/c/Fireship) YT channel.

## // [this](#LearnJavascript).repo

JavaScript in the browser has evolved. Developers who want to take advantage of the latest features have the option of going framework-less with less hassle.

Functionally normally reserved to front-end frameworks, like a component-based approach, is now feasible in plain old JavaScript.

This repo contains code for such app whose goal is to help people learn javascript by providing rhem with a beginner friendly _Javascript Playground._ (and also help [maintainers](I m currentlty still alone but Im open for contributions) learn through the process.)

Learn Javascript "data structures and algorithms" then practice them in Interactive Web app projects.

## // Notes

> This project uses JS algorithms from [the-algorithms.com](https://the-algorithms.com/language/javascript).

### Issues (and common fixes)

When you start the app after it has previously crashed, you may receive [Error `EADDRINUSE`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4075287/node-express-eaddrinuse-address-already-in-use-kill-server)
or when `npm start` failed. ie:

> EADDRINUSE, Address already in use

To fix this (On Windows):
