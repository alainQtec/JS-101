## [This repo](#learnjavascript)

JavaScript in the browser has evolved. Developers who want to take advantage of the latest features have the option of going framework-less with less hassle.

Functionally normally reserved to front-end frameworks, like a component-based approach, is now feasible in plain old JavaScript.

This repo contains source for the Playground and code examples. The goal is to help people learn javascript by providing them with enough and organised resources.

I believe this can prevent tutorial hell.
